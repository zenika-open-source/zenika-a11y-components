> The Zenika A11Y Component project provide a very basic and versatile design toolkit that can fit in any project. It put accessibility and usability first and is a perfect starting point to build up more complex design systems or to fit into existing ones.


## Why this project

At Zenika we have the opportunity to work on many different environments and we are often confront to the same requests and issues. When it comes to front-end development, the diversity of technical environments and functional requirements is extreme. Because of that, we have a unique perspective and some knowledge to share. Through this project we intent to centralize our knowledge by creating **a simple design toolkit** that contain all _our best practices regarding web design and front-end development_.

It is a simple way to make sure that the good work we are doing with a given framework or tool can be replicated with another one without reinventing the wheel each time. It's also a good way to normalize and document all our best practices regarding the development and the design of UI component. To some extend _it's a form of a knowledge base dedicated to our future colleagues and the whole web community_.

For all of our components we intent to :
 - Document their functional and technical requirements.
 - Design them in a way that allow to use them as a standalone design system or as a companionship to any existing design systems.
 - Implement them for as many framework as possible.
 - Ensure that their are fully compliant to WCAG 2.1 AA out of the box.
 - Test them extensively (including real-life screen reader usage).

This design toolkit is a foundational work made to demonstrate Zenika exceptional skills regarding web design and front-end development.
