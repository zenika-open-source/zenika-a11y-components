   * Basically, to be fully accessible, a show/hide full sequence has to be:
   *
   * 1. The element isn't in the DOM
   * 2. The element is in the DOM, but is hidden "hard" (`display:none` or attribute `hidden`)
   * 3. The element is in the DOM, but is hidden "soft" (not visible, but readable by screenreaders)
   * 4. The element is in the DOM and visible
   *
   * If you want to apply a CSS transition it can only be done between step 3 and 4
   * so we need a dedicated CSS class to materialized step 3.
